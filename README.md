## OPSI - Computational Foundations of Artificial Intelligence (Obliczeniowe Podstawy Sztucznej Inteligencji)
The goal of the project was to extract the respiratory component from the ECG (electrocardiogram) signal using different distributions (PCA, kPCA and ICA). The results obtained had some inaccuracies, but reproduced the model respiratory component.

## PGiPD - Acquisition, Collection and Processing of Biomedical Data (Pozyskiwanie, Gromadzenie i Przetwarzanie Danych Biomedycznych)
The aim of the project was to repeat the operations carried out on the data in the scientific article, as well as to analyze the results obtained. In the course, however, the wavelet transform was abandoned in favor of fast Fourier transform (FFT). Nonetheless, it was not possible to obtain the same results as in the article.

## WSI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Wprowadzenie do Sztucznej Inteligencji)
The goal of this project was to become familiar with the entire process that the data prepared for the AI undergoes. Starting with the selection of the database (archaic ones were selected for additional difficulty), through exploration and preprocessing, and ending with learning the selected models (kNN algorithm, decision trees and SVM) and determining their effectiveness (f1-score).
